          <h1>About Aidin and This App</h1>

          <p class="lead">Aidin empowers hospital leaders, patients, and post acute providers with real-time quality and satisfaction data to make informed decisions.</p>

          <p class="lead">This app allows users to log in and log out. Visitors can view empowering information about post-acute providers and leave comments about said providers by clicking "View Providers" on the home page. The providers can be added, updated, or deleted ("able to create, edit, delete records").</p>

          <p class="lead">There will be a list of providers whose locations are shown on a Google map ("geocoder API use"). If a visitor clicks on "show," he or she will see information about that provider. A provider has many comments ("include relational objects"). A visitor may click on the "Comments" link to toggle comments about the provider ("AJAX request").</p>

          <p class="lead">If a visitor adds a new provider with an address (e.g., Paris, France or Baltimore, USA), the provider's location will show up on a Google map below the list of all providers.</p>

          <p class="lead">Finally, the navigation bar and comments use partials ("uses partials").</p>
