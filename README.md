Aidin App
================

Ruby on Rails
-------------

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.2.2
- Rails 4.2.3


Getting Started
---------------

This application fulfills all of the criteria:
1. is able to create, edit, and remove records (you can complete CRUD operations for providers).
2. include relational objects (a provider has many comments).
3. uses partials (the navigation bar uses partials as does the provider show view for comments).
4. includes Google maps (I used geocoder; the locations of providers are shown on a map on the provider index view).
5. includes an AJAX request (you can toggle comments about a provider on the provider show view).

Issues
-------------

If the Google map under "Listing Providers" doesn't load, hit refresh.
